# Portfolio-HW


## Description

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a portfolio web application without any starter code. This application has multiple sections: home, about, projects and contact. Each section is linked to an active navagation bar. Flexboxes were utilized to accomodate to changing screen sizes. I will be adding to this application as I progress through the course.
